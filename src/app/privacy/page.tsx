            <p>
              You have the right to object to or request restriction of certain

            <h3>Location Data</h3>
            <p>
              You can control our access to your location data through your device
              settings. Please note that disabling location services will

            <p>
              Some browsers include a &quot;Do Not Track&quot; (DNT) feature.
              Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret
              DNT signals, we do not currently respond to DNT signals.
