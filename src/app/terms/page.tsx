            <h3>Third-Party Applications and Services</h3>
            <p>The Roam X Service is integrated with third-party authentication services (Google and Apple) to facilitate account creation and login.

            <h3>Restaurant Information</h3>
            <p>Roam X provides restaurant recommendations and information based on data from various sources. Restaurant availability, menu items, pricing, hours of operation, and other details are controlled by the restaurants themselves and may change without notice. Roam X makes reasonable efforts to provide accurate information but does not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of restaurant information displayed in the Service. Roam X is not responsible for restaurant service quality, food safety, menu accuracy, or any aspect of your dining experience at restaurants. Restaurants are independent businesses, and your interactions with them are not controlled by Roam X.</p>
            <h3>Service Limitations and Modifications</h3>
            <p>We use reasonable efforts to keep the Roam X Service operational and to provide you with personalized restaurant discovery experiences. However, Roam X reserves the right to change our service offerings and their availability from time to time, without notice or liability to you. For example:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The Roam X Service may experience temporary interruptions due to technical difficulties, maintenance, or updates, including those required to reflect changes in relevant laws and regulatory requirements</li>
              <li>We aim to evolve and improve the Roam X Service constantly, and we may modify, suspend, or stop (permanently or temporarily) providing all or part of the Roam X Service (including particular functions, features, and promotional offerings)</li>
              <li>Restaurant information and availability may change. Roam X has no obligation to provide information about any specific restaurant through the Roam X Service, and restaurant data may be updated or removed without notice</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Your right to terminate these Terms if you no longer want to use the Roam X Service is set forth in Section 6 below. Roam X has no liability to you, nor any obligation to provide a refund to you, in connection with internet or other service outages or failures that are caused by the actions of government authorities, other third parties, or events beyond our control.</p>

Please use caution when making content public, as you cannot control how other users may use or share public content. Roam X is not responsible for what you or others post or share on the Roam X Service.</p>
            <h3>Monitoring User Content</h3>

Where applicable and to the extent permitted under applicable law, you also agree to waive, and not to enforce, any "moral rights" or equivalent rights, such as your right to be identified as the author of any User Content and your right to object to derogatory treatment of such User Content.</p>
            <h3>Feedback</h3>
            <p>If you provide ideas, suggestions, or other feedback in connection with your use of the Roam X Service ("Feedback"), such Feedback is not confidential and may be used by Roam X without restriction and without payment to you. Feedback is considered a type of User Content under these Terms.</p>

The restaurant recommendations that you receive, including their selection, ranking, and placement, may be influenced by commercial considerations, including Roam X's agreements with restaurant partners and third parties. Some restaurants may receive preferential placement in search results or recommendations based on partnerships, promotional arrangements, or other business relationships. However, our primary goal is to provide you with recommendations that match your preferences and dining needs.</p>

            <h3>Warranty Disclaimers</h3>
            <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitations on applicable statutory rights of a consumer, so the exclusion and limitations in this section may not apply to you.

              <li>Any activity in which you engage on or through the Roam X Service</li>

            <h3>Governing Law, Jurisdiction, and Jury Trial Waiver</h3>
            <p>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, these Terms and any dispute, claim, and/or controversy that in any way relates to or arises in connection with these Terms or your relationship with Roam X as a user of the Roam X Service ("Dispute") are governed by and shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, except to the extent preempted by or inconsistent with federal law. Further, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you and Roam X agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal or state courts located in Delaware to resolve any Dispute that is not subject to mandatory arbitration under the Arbitration Agreement below, and waive any jurisdictional, venue, or inconvenient forum objections to such courts. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the parties agree to waive any right to a jury trial.</p>
            <h3>ARBITRATION AGREEMENT</h3>
            <p>This Arbitration Agreement section sets forth the terms and conditions pursuant to which Disputes between you and Roam X will be resolved through individual arbitration ("Arbitration Agreement").</p>
            <h3>Dispute Resolution and Arbitration</h3>
            <p>Subject to the exceptions set forth in the "Exceptions to arbitration" section below, you and Roam X agree that any Dispute between you and Roam X (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of these Terms) will be determined by binding individual (not class) arbitration. The arbitrator has the authority to rule on all issues except that a court has exclusive authority to:</p>
            <ol className={styles.numbered}>
              <li>Decide arbitrability, as well as scope, validity, and enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement</li>
              <li>Decide whether you and Roam X have complied with the pre-arbitration filing requirements (including the requirements described in the "Pre-arbitration notice of dispute and informal resolution period" section below)</li>
              <li>Enforce the prohibition on class or representative actions</li>
              <li>Enjoin an arbitration from proceeding if it does not comply with this Arbitration Agreement</li>
            </ol>
            <p>THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED. The arbitrator can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorneys' fees and costs where allowable under applicable law), except that the arbitrator may not award any relief, including declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration. This arbitration provision will survive termination of these Terms.</p>
            <h3>Exceptions to Arbitration</h3>
            <p>You and Roam X both agree that nothing in this Arbitration Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of your or Roam X's rights, at any time, to elect to have an individual action heard in:</p>
            <ol className={styles.numbered}>
              <li>A U.S. small claims court (so long as the action is litigated exclusively in small claims court and is not removed or appealed to a court of general jurisdiction)</li>
              <li>A court of law, in accordance with the jurisdiction and venue described in the "Governing law, jurisdiction, and jury trial waiver" section above, seeking only temporary or preliminary individualized injunctive relief, pending a final ruling from the arbitrator</li>
            </ol>
            <p>In addition, this Arbitration Agreement does not stop you or us from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies. Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf (or vice versa).</p>
            <h3>No Class or Representative Proceedings and Class Action Waiver</h3>
            <p>YOU AND ROAM X AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER IN ARBITRATION OR LITIGATION ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, COLLECTIVE, CONSOLIDATED, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. Unless both you and Roam X agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person's claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. The arbitrator may award injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. If a court decides that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this paragraph's limitations as to a particular claim for relief, then that claim must be severed from the arbitration and brought in court. All other claims will be arbitrated.</p>
            <h3>Pre-Arbitration Notice of Dispute and Informal Resolution Period</h3>
            <p>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the Dispute ("Notice") to the other. Notices to Roam X must be sent by email to disputes@roamxai.com, and Notices to you must be sent to the email address associated with your Roam X account. All Notices must:</p>
            <ol className={styles.numbered}>
              <li>Be personally signed by the party sending the Notice (or their authorized representative)</li>
              <li>Provide your name and email address associated with your Roam X account</li>
              <li>Provide your address of residence (and if different, mailing address)</li>
              <li>Describe with specificity the nature and basis of the Dispute</li>
              <li>Set forth the specific relief sought, including any calculation of alleged damages</li>
            </ol>
            <p>After a Notice containing all of the information required above is received, the parties agree to engage in good faith for a period of sixty (60) days in an effort to resolve the Dispute informally ("Informal Resolution Period"). The party receiving the Notice may request a telephone or video conference during the Informal Resolution Period to facilitate resolution. Any applicable statute of limitations or contractual limitations period will be tolled during the Informal Resolution Period and for thirty (30) days thereafter. Neither you nor Roam X may commence an arbitration proceeding until after the Informal Resolution Period has ended.</p>
            <h3>Arbitration Rules and Fees</h3>
            <p>Either you or Roam X may start arbitration proceedings. Any arbitration between you and Roam X will be administered by National Arbitration and Mediation ("NAM") in accordance with their Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures, as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. The NAM Rules, as well as instructions on how to file a demand for arbitration, appear at www.namadr.com. The demand for arbitration must attach the relevant Notice and be personally signed by the party initiating the arbitration (or their authorized representative). If NAM is unavailable, unwilling, or otherwise unable to administer an arbitration in accordance with this Arbitration Agreement, then another arbitration administrator that will do so will be selected by agreement of the parties, or if the parties cannot agree, by petition to a court of competent jurisdiction. Roam X will pay all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees if it initiates an arbitration. If you choose to file an arbitration proceeding, the allocation and payment of fees will be governed by the NAM Rules, unless a different allocation is required for this Arbitration Agreement to be enforced. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based.</p>
            <h3>Enforceability</h3>
            <p>If this Arbitration Agreement is invalidated in whole, the parties agree that they may seek to resolve the Dispute in a U.S. small claims court or in the courts specified in the "Governing law, jurisdiction, and jury trial waiver" section above. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each party may bring a Dispute against the other party only in an individual capacity and not participate as a plaintiff, claimant, or class member in any class, collective, consolidated, private attorney general, or representative proceeding. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may participate in a class-wide settlement.</p>

            <h3>Changes to These Terms</h3>
            <p>We may make changes to these Terms from time to time by notifying you of such changes by any reasonable means, including by posting the revised Terms within the Roam X Service (provided that, for material changes, we will seek to supplement such notice by email, an in-app pop-up message, or other prominent notice within the Service). Your use of the Roam X Service following any changes to these Terms will constitute your acceptance of such changes. If you do not wish to continue using the Roam X Service under the updated Terms, you must close your Roam X account prior to the effective date of the updated Terms. If Roam X makes any material change to the Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to the notice address), you may reject any such change by sending us a personally signed, written notice of your decision to opt out of those changes via email to disputes@roamxai.com within thirty (30) days of when we notify users of the change. This opt-out notice must include: (1) your name, address, email address associated with your Roam X account, and username. Such an opt-out must be sent by you personally, and not by an agent, attorney, or anyone else purporting to act on your behalf. Opting out of a material change to the Arbitration Agreement is not an opt-out of arbitration altogether. Even if you opt out of a material change to the Arbitration Agreement, you and Roam X agree that any Dispute will be determined by binding individual (not class) arbitration in accordance with the Arbitration Agreement in effect immediately before any such change.</p>

Any failure by Roam X to enforce these Terms or any provision thereof shall not waive Roam X's right to do so.</p>
            <h3>Assignment</h3>
